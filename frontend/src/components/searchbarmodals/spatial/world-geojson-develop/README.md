# World boundaries in GeoJSON format
This repository contains GeoJSON data for all the countries boundaries including boundaries for states of bigger 
countries (note that this repository is currently filling).
Detalization is good for using this data on scales up to 1:10000000 / gmaps zoom 6-7 (it's the best quality in combination with free-to-use license).
Data is created using [geojson.io](http://geojson.io/) tool.

Contries boundaries besides mainlands include all the geographically separated, but de jure dependent, associated and managed territories. Separated mainland and all the territories mentioned are added in release 2. Countries states are to be added in release 3.

## Additional areas (release 2.0)

## States boundaries (in progress)
Countries which we are going to provide state boundaries for:
* Australia (ready)
* Argentina (pending: 24)
* Brazil (pending: 26)
* Canada (ready / OSM / low quality)
* China (pending: 33)
* India (pending: 29)
* Indonesia (pending: 34)
* Kazakhstan (pending: 14)
* Mexico (pending: 31)
* Philippines (pending: 18)
* Russia (pending: 83)
* USA (ready, OSM data)

Note that some states boundaries are provided by OSM, however quality of that data is much lower.

## Roadmap
Future planned changes and improvements are:
* Most of the countries boundaries were prepared manually, so borders don't perfectly align - that is to be improved (work started)
* Replace states boundaries provided by OSM with manually-done boundaries with much better quality.
